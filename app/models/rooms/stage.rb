# Rooms with a standing stage huddle: a few members speak while everyone else
# listens. Hosts run the stage, speakers publish audio/video, and listeners
# can only subscribe. Membership works like Rooms::Voice, with explicit
# members chosen by an administrator or the creator, plus a per-member stage
# role. The room creator becomes the first host.
